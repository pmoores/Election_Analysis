# Module 3 Challenge - Election Audit

## Overview of the Election Audit
The purpose of this analysis is to perform an election audit on election data to provide the following information to the Colorado Board of Elections:
 - Total number of votes cast in the election
 - Total number of votes and vote percentage for each county in the election
 - County with the largest number of votes cast
 - Total number of votes and vote percentage for each candidate in the election
 - The winning candidate


## Resources
The following resources were used to perform this analysis
- Data Source: election_results.csv
- Software: Python 3.7.5, Visual Studio Code 1.58.0

## Election-Audit Summary: 
The script used for this coding audit successfully retrieved vital information about the proportion of votes received by each candidate and votes cast from each county. This script is also very versatile and can be used to perform other analyses:
 - Example 1: The code can be expanded with very little modification to compare election results between numerous counties and candidates. In fact, this would be as simple as loading a different csv data file.
 - Example 2: A wide variety of statistical analysis methods can be run on this data to create a deeper analysis. For instance, the voting percentages from numerous counties can be compared to determine voter engagement in each county and develop strategies to increase voter engagement where needed.
